# 1D Upper Matrix Multiplication in C
Multiply two **upper** triangular matrices only by using their one-dimensional representations of the non-zero values
The purpose of this program is to not use 2D arrays (matrices) during the proccess, making it more memory-efficient.
# Usage
Download the `.c` file however you'd like and run in your compiler of choice (preferably GCC) after providing an input file or using mine.
